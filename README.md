_A Personalized Task Optimizer and Productivity Analytics Application Using Task Prioritization & Scheduling Algorithm_

</div>

## üîç Project Description

Modo is an intelligent productivity companion built to help users take control of their daily tasks through personalized optimization and smart scheduling. By using task prioritization algorithms and data-driven analytics, Modo helps users manage time efficiently, reduce overload, and increase focus.

## üéØ Objectives of the Study

- To develop an intelligent task prioritization and scheduling algorithm that dynamically adjusts task order based on urgency, importance, and user preferences.
- To implement an AI-powered productivity analytics system to track user performance trends and provide actionable insights for improved efficiency.
- To integrate adaptive learning capabilities to personalize task recommendations and optimize scheduling based on user habits.
- To enhance user experience by designing an intuitive, interactive interface that ensures smooth navigation and seamless usability.
- To introduce a motivational reward system featuring badges, milestones, and other incentives to encourage productivity and consistency.

## üìä Scope and Limitations

- The system will implement individual task management rather than team-based or enterprise project management.
- The system will be launched exclusively as a mobile application on a specified operating system, with cross-platform compatibility excluded for the initial release.
- The system will use AI-based analytics and machine learning will enhance productivity recommendations, while users retain manual control over their schedules.
- The system will feature an integrated calendar for task scheduling and organization, eliminating the need for external calendar integrations.
- The system will offer comprehensive reports and insights into productivity.

### Scope of the Study

**Objective**: The system is designed to maximize productivity and time management during work by using automated scheduling of tasks with the help of its algorithms. The overall idea behind the system is to automate the scheduling of users' tasks in a manner that he or she can prioritize them in the personal work schedule. Modo wants to enable a multimedia goal-setting and tracking process with easily accessible and organized tasks and productivity measures that can inform user decisions. The system uses machine learning to understand work routines and generate smart schedules, helping users avoid procrastination, prevent task overload, and maintain a healthy work-life balance.

### Limitations of the Study

- The system is intended for individual use and does not support collaboration, team-based, or organizational project management.
- The system will not support offline functionality; all features require an active internet connection for data syncing.
- The system does not permit users to manually adjust or customize the AI parameters, as its adaptive learning capabilities are solely focused on optimizing task scheduling based on observed user habits.
- The system will include a built-in calendar, removing the need for integration with third-party calendar applications.
- The system focuses solely on task scheduling and optimization; it will not include financial management, note-taking, or document storage functionalities.
